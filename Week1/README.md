## Installation and setup
To get started with our project _Computational Physics_ we need to first intall and set-up certain softwares

### Python
We will be using python as the programming language in this project. Python is a very user-friendly language with syntax similar to english language. It has an extensive collection of libraries which makes very useful for many different purposes, including scientific and numeric computing.
Follow the instructions in following link to install python:
- Windows: https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-install-python-3-windows
- Mac: https://flaviocopes.com/python-installation-macos/


Note:Remember to add python to PATH.

### Github
Github is online platform which is mainly used by coders and developers to collaborate with each other. In very basic terms Github can be thought of as a google drive of codes (but there's much more to it). You will need to submit your assignments on github. So if you don't have an account on github, do make one and install and set-up git using these instructions https://github.com/git-guides/install-git,https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git.

You can use the following resources to get a basic idea about git and github:

### Jupyter notebook
Jupyter notebook is an interactive enviornment which is used to share code snippets in cells. It makes the ccode quite easy to understand and maintain. We will be using Jupyter notebooks in this project. You can download Jupyter notebooks by downloading Anaconda, or you can also install jupyter using python pip.



## Python basics
Refer to python basics jupyter notebook uploaded and try to get comfortable with the syntax of python. Get some basic concepts like loops, functions, if-else clear. You can also refer to following resources:
- links

For our purposes we do not need to go too deep into python, rather just get a basic understanding.
## Numpy

## Matplotlib
